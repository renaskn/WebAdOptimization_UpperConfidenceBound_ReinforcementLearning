Web Ad Optimization using Upper Confidence Bound - Reinforcement Learning
A simple machine learning project to optimize web advertisements using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm in Reinforcement Learning. The objective is to identify which advertisement performs the best based on Click-Through Rate (CTR).

## Description
This project implements the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm to optimize web advertisements. The goal is to determine which advertisement yields the highest click-through rate (CTR). The dataset used for this project contains 10,000 observations and 10 different ads. The UCB algorithm is used to select ads that maximize user engagement by balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in reinforcement learning problems.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 10,000 observations with the following structure:

10 columns representing different ads.
Each row represents a user's interaction with the ads, where 1 indicates a click and 0 indicates no click.
